Folder has data and code for bouton size analysis

Guidance for code etc needed is in the runfunctions.m file - hopefully most of it self-explanatory, but will discuss more.

- boutsize_data_groupAB_Days1-4.mat file has all bouton size concatenated data variables by day and group

- individual folders house individual mat files that have data for each 'mouse' and 'image' (e.g., under 'aDay1' is '211-3_001 BLU ROI b1.zip.csv.mat' which houses the bouton sizes for mouse '211-3', image '001', etc...) - so for our purposes, if we need individual 'image averages'/numbers you can group files by animal-image# (so all 211-3_001* bouton sizes are averaged together, all 805-2_004* files are averaged together, if only one image, just average those within that one animal's image file...
